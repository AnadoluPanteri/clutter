clutter (0.8.2-0maemo14~unreleased) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified clutter_stage_redraw_damage so that the stage can be redrawn with
    a delay - which helps get rid of multiple redraws when we get >1 XDamage
    events within a few ms of each other. Currently this is set to 0 delay as 
    we found it didn't help much.
  * Added CLUTTER_TEXTURE_FLAG_16_BIT to force 16 bit textures in 
    set_from_rgb_data
  * Added clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_add_shape to deal with transparency in
    textures via XShapeGetRectangles    
  * Modified eglx_texture_pixmap to try creating a texture with alpha before
    it creates one without - this solves the transparent window issue on Rover
  * removed warning from GL/cogl.c
  * quick fix to get update area working on scratchbox

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo13) unstable; urgency=low

  * added cogl_modify_clip_viewport to allow rendering to a specific area (gw)
  * Modified redraw_damage code to allow redraw using viewport rather than 
    glScissor (gw)
  * Stopped eglx-texture-pixmap from creating a new texture on ANY change event, 
    and instead do it only when width/height/depth changes (gw)
  * Set up xevent handlers in clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c only if
    XDAMAGE_HANDLING is defined. This avoids doing damage handling twice for
    application windows and should avoid some surprises in libmatchbox2 side
    (kh).
  * Do not alter XComposite redirections in clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c, that
    belongs to the window manager (kh).
  * Removed some un-needed log messages for EGLX textures (gw)
  * Set damage to update the whole screen after a 'pick' event (as it will have
    destroyed the buffer)
  * Commented out extra code that caused clutter to not compile with -Werror
  * Reinstated XDamage and XComposite as something in it reverted bug 95594 
    (and multiple XDamage shouldn't be an issue with the next bunch of work
    I'm working on).

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo12) unstable; urgency=low

  * check for EGL_NOKIA_texture_from_pixmap, not EGL_EXT_...
  * Added clutter_actor_set_allow_redraw to stop certain actors forcing redraw
  * Added clutter_stage_set_damaged_area to allow redraw of only damaged areas
  * Added clutter_actor_set_visibility_detect to skip visibility detection on
    stuff that doesn't play fair - like h-d task navigator
  * Added clutter_actor_queue_redraw_damage to allow a redraw to be queued
    without the whole screen being marked as damaged.

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added PVRTC4 Texture compressor + decompressor
  * Added PVR decompressor fallback for loading PVRs on GL
  * Removed optional PVR loading code from clutter-texture
  * Made cogl-texture understand and load .pvr files
  * added cogl_bitmap_save_pvrtc4 to save compressed pvr file 
    so it can be used for h-d backgrounds
  * added extra 1 byte per pixel texture formats to 
    clutter_texture_set_from_rgb_data for gaussian shadows in
    matchbox
  * Removed visibility check for redraw as I think it adds more trouble
    than it solves
  * Added null-pointer check for container sort
  * Exposed cogl_blend_func to let tidy-blur-group work properly
    with transparent textures
  * Removed 'updating texture' messages fom EGL TFP
  * Fixed several warnings throughout the code
  * added more useful debug message to EGL TFP
  * Kimmo: Add check before queuing a paint in update_area in EGL TFP.
  * Kimmo: Use new libgles2 and libgles2-dev packages.

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added cogl-pvr-texture file to allow GLES to load PVR compressed textures
    if they exist
  * Replaced stencil-based clipping with WAY faster scissor-based clipping
    for the case where we're clipping to rectangles
  * Removed instantiation of surfaces with a stencil buffer for GLES
    as we won't need it now
  * Moved matrix functions from clutter-actor to cogl-util (+ added unproject)
  * Added stencil area to visibility detection so we don't even ask
    GLES to draw outside clipping regions (eg. for lists)
  * Modified pixel shaders to use lowp (int10) where possible instead of
    mediump (float16)
  * Now compile with Werror and modified some code accordingly
  * Added code to allow notification of modification of children to parent
    containers - used when a texture is used in a container to cache the 
    state of its children (specifically tidy-blur-group in h-d)
  * Modified COGL to add cogl_texture_triangles to allow fast drawing on GLES
  * Modified Pango Renderer to use one call to cogl_texture_triangles rather
    than many calls to cogl_texture_rectangle
  * Modified cogl-bitmap-pixbuf to only use a single memcpy on load rather than
    one per scanline

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added visibility checking for actors
  * Added more useful Clutter debug prints for [PAINT]
  * Added automatic naming of textures (if created with new_file) for [PAINT]

  * Added short-cut to stop matrix multiply for scale 1,1,1 and translate 0,0,0
  * Removed GL_LIGHTING which caused invalid_enum for GLES2
  * Re-arranged CoglPixelFormat so it works now and has more obvious macros
  * Removed error-prone lookup table in cogl-bitmap
  * Added more fast paths for pixel format conversion
  * Added PIXEL_FORMAT_ANY_16 to select the best 16 bit pixel format for a texture
  * MAEMO SPECIFIC: MADE clutter-texture ALWAYS USE 16 BIT

  * Fixed fixed-point issues for FBOs as well as normal buffers

    eglBindTexImage had failed.
